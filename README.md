# DeOldify

Simply put, the mission of this project is to colorize and restore old images.  I'll get into the details later, but let's get to the pictures first!  BTW- most of these source images originally came from TheWayWeWere subreddit at Reddit, so credit to them for finding such great photos.

#### Some of many results- These are pretty typical results!

#### Note that even really poor quality and/or old photos will still turn out looking pretty cool:

#### It can also colorize drawings:
